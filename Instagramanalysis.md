## Part A: Understanding the App

**App Analyzed:** Instagram  
**Role:** App Analyst – Puoch Mabor Makuei

### 1. App Overview

**What problem does this app solve?**  
Instagram solves the problem of visual-first communication at scale. Before platforms like Instagram, sharing photos or videos required fragmented tools or private messaging. Instagram brings creation, editing, publishing, and discovery of visual content into a single mobile-first platform.

Beyond sharing, Instagram addresses content discovery and engagement. Users are continuously shown content aligned with their interests through personalized feeds, stories, and reels. For creators and businesses, Instagram acts as a distribution and marketing platform where attention can be converted into influence, reach, or income. In practice, Instagram functions as both a social network and a large-scale content delivery system.

**Who are its primary users?**  
Instagram’s primary users are mobile-first individuals, largely between the ages of 18–34. These include casual users sharing daily moments, content creators building personal brands, influencers monetizing audiences, and businesses marketing products and services.

In regions such as Uganda and across Africa, Instagram is also widely used by small businesses, freelancers, and creatives as a lightweight alternative to full websites. This makes the platform socially relevant and economically important, especially in mobile-dominated markets.

  Users create accounts, log in securely, and manage profiles that represent their identity on the platform. Profiles consolidate posts, followers, bios, and activity history.

  Stories allow temporary photo or video posts that disappear after 24 hours. They support interactive elements like polls, questions, and reactions, encouraging frequent and informal sharing.

- **Reels (Short-form Video)**  
  Reels enable users to create and consume short, engaging videos designed for discovery beyond their follower base. This feature is central to Instagram’s growth and engagement strategy.

- **Direct Messaging (DMs)**  
  Instagram includes private messaging for one-on-one and group conversations, supporting text, images, videos, voice notes, and shared posts.

- **Notifications & Activity Tracking**
