## Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration

**1. Explain the differences between Programming and software construction using one real life World Example**
Programming mainly focuses on writing code to implement specific functionality, such as creating a function or solving a problem using a programming language. Software construction is broader — it includes designing, structuring, testing, documenting, debugging, and maintaining software in a reliable and scalable way.

Real-world example:
Imagine building a smart transportation system in Kampala. Programming would involve writing code to calculate traffic routes or manage GPS data. Software construction would include planning the architecture, organizing modules, handling errors, writing tests, documenting APIs, and ensuring the system can be updated as the city grows. Programming is one part of the larger software construction process.

**2. Describe a situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems**
**3. Explain why version control is important in team based software development**
**4. Describe how code reviews improve both software quality and developer skills**
**5. Reflect briefly on how AI can help in understanding code without replacing learning.**


## Key TakeAway for Students
Software Construction is not about writing more code, its about building software that survives change, supports teamwork and earns trust!
