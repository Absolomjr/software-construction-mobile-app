## Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration

**1. Explain the differences between Programming and software construction using one real life World Example**
**2. Describe a situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems**
**3. Explain why version control is important in team based software development**
**4. Describe how code reviews improve both software quality and developer skills**
**5. Reflect briefly on how AI can help in understanding code without replacing learning.**


## Key TakeAway for Students
Software Construction is not about writing more code, its about building software that survives change, supports teamwork and earns trust!

### *2. Situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems*

Consider a hospital management system developed without proper structure, naming conventions, or documentation. If the original developers leave and new developers must update the system urgently for example, to fix a patient-data bug the confusing code could lead to mistakes. This might cause incorrect patient records, delays in treatment, or even privacy breaches. Poor maintainability increases risk, cost, and downtime because small changes become difficult and dangerous.
