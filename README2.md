## Understanding Software Construction and Collaboration



### *1. Difference between Programming and Software Construction (with a real-world example)*

Programming mainly focuses on writing code to implement specific functionality, such as creating a function or solving a problem using a programming language. Software construction is broader. it includes *designing, structuring, testing, documenting, debugging, and maintaining* software in a reliable and scalable way.

**Real-world example:**
Imagine building a *smart transportation system in Kampala*. Programming would involve writing code to calculate traffic routes or manage GPS data. Software construction would include planning the architecture, organizing modules, handling errors, writing tests, documenting APIs, and ensuring the system can be updated as the city grows. Programming is one part of the larger software construction process.


### *2. Situation where poor maintainability could cause serious problems*

Consider a hospital management system developed without proper structure, naming conventions, or documentation. If the original developers leave and new developers must update the system urgently for example, to fix a patient-data bug the confusing code could lead to mistakes. This might cause incorrect patient records, delays in treatment, or even privacy breaches. Poor maintainability increases risk, cost, and downtime because small changes become difficult and dangerous.



### *3. Explain why version control is important in team based software development*

Version control systems like Git help teams collaborate safely by tracking changes and maintaining history. They allow multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work. If something breaks, teams can revert to a previous stable version. Version control also improves accountability through commits and makes collaboration structured using branches, pull requests, and merges.HEAD



### *4. How code reviews improve software quality and developer skills*

Code reviews allow developers to examine each other’s work before it becomes part of the main project. This helps detect bugs, security issues, and inefficient logic early, improving overall software quality. At the same time, developers learn new techniques, coding standards, and best practices from feedback. Junior developers gain mentorship, while experienced developers refine their communication and design thinking skills.


### *5. Reflect briefly on how AI can help in understanding code without replacing learning.*

AI can support developers by explaining unfamiliar code, suggesting improvements, and helping identify errors quickly. For example, it can break down complex functions into simpler explanations or provide examples of best practices. However, responsible use means treating AI as a *learning assistant*, not a replacement for thinking. Developers should still analyze problems themselves, verify AI suggestions, and practice writing their own solutions to build deep understanding and long-term skills
